# 23andMe, The Personal Genomics Company

We were able to choose from any sequencing company we could research, but seeing 23andMe on the list intrigued me. I have heard a lot about it, but never bothered looking into how it works, the history, etc. Today, I have chosen 23andMe as the company I'll research, and I'll share my findings with you.

## What is 23andMe?

23andMe was founded in April 2006 by Linda Avey, Anne Wojcicki, and Paul Cusenza to give individuals an easy way to discover their genetic makeup and interpretation(23andMe Blog). I'm willing to bet not many of us know that the first public DNA interpretation service was founded in 1987: Cellmark. So, this kind of technology wasn't new... But it was particularly unique since its main focus wasn't paternity tests, but to satiate our innate curiosity of who we are. That, and to see what our health risks could be. 

Google invested 3.9 million into the company in 2007(Wikipedia). Data on initial investments aren't readily available, and this is the earliest I could find.
