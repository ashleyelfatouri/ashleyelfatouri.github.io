# 23andMe, The Personal Genomics Company

We were able to choose from any sequencing company we could research, but seeing 23andMe on the list intrigued me. I have heard a lot about it, but never bothered looking into how it works, the history, etc. Today, I have chosen 23andMe as the company I'll research, and I'll share my findings with you.

## What is 23andMe?

23andMe was founded in April 2006 by Linda Avey, Anne Wojcicki, and Paul Cusenza to give individuals an easy way to discover their genetic makeup and interpretation(23andMe Blog). 

I'm willing to bet not many of us know that the first public DNA interpretation service was founded in 1987: Cellmark. So, this kind of technology wasn't new... But it was particularly unique since its main focus wasn't paternity tests, but to satiate our innate curiosity of who we are. That, and to see what our health risks could be. 

Google invested 3.9 million into the company in 2007(Wikipedia). Data on initial investments aren't readily available, and this is the earliest I could find.
According to CNBC and Yahoo Finance, at the company's peak in 2021 it was worth 6 billion following a merger with a SPAC. 

After that, it struggled to bring in consistent revenue, and slowly declined as time went by, and by 2024 its value was only 2% of its peak. In March 2025, Wojcicki filed for bankruptcy and resigned.

## The 2023 Data Breach

This was salt on the festering wound of 23andMe's failure! In October 2023, through a credential stuffing attack(using stolen login information), the private information of 7 million customers was exposed. The primary victims were Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese users. 

In 2024, a class action lawsuit was settled for 30 million by them. Then a joint Canadian UK investigation ended in them being sued for 2.31 million GBP.

23andMe is still struggling... but Yahoo Finance says Wojcicki wants to buy it back for over 40 million.
