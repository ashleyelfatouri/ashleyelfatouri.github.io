First blog post yay

My name is Ashley, I'm majoring in criminal justice, and I'm graduating in 2029. 

I'm not sure what I want to do with my life just yet. I always jump between going into forensic science and being a corporate attorney.

I like going out with friends, listening to music, drawing, and computer gaming. I also like getting to know others :)

So far my favorite subject is criminal justice.
