# Are you defined by your genome?
## Kind of... but not really.
What does that even mean? 
Your genomes define the most major parts of you. Your appearance, your health, perhaps your personality. So the answer might as well be yes. But it's never that simple. Some, just by hearing this, take your genome as pure biological determinism of who you are as a whole. Twin and family studies even suggest that IQ and many personality traits are hereditary, but it doesn't tell the full story. Who you are as a person isn't determined entirely by your genetic code. I decided to do some research to see just how far your genome can go in defining you, and how much it can't.
