# Are you defined by your genome?
## Kind of... but not really.
What does that even mean? 

Your genomes define the most major parts of you. Your appearance, your health, perhaps your personality. So the answer might as well be yes. But it's never that simple. Some, just by hearing this, take your genome as pure biological determinism of who you are as a whole. Twin and family studies even suggest that IQ and many personality traits are hereditary, but it doesn't tell the full story. Who you are as a person isn't determined entirely by your genetic code. I decided to do some research to see just how far your genome can go in defining you, and how much it can't.

According to genome.gov, just about everything physical is defined by your genome. From your hair color to your eye color, susceptibility to diseases, your appearance, are all determined by your genome. In fact, all humans are genetically 99.9% identical... except for that small percentage that accounts for our uniqueness. Pretty cool!

Now, things can happen to us that genomes don't always determine. Those who grew up with a slightly chubbier build in a family of chubbier people can end up losing weight, or going through other drastic changes. Your genome doesn't "lock" you into anything. It gets more complex when accounting for gene-enviornment interaction and epigenetics. How often a gene can effect you can depend on the environment... For example, genes can turn "on or off" depending on lifestyle and environment, without notably altering your genetic sequence. According to NC State News' Nurture Over Nature, from a population in Morocco, up to a third of gene expression can change when comparing those who live in an urban vs. a rural environment.

Of course, there's limits to everything. Your genomes can kind of "set" an upper and lower boundary of what's dangerous or healthy for you, like certain deficiencies not having as adverse an effect on some than others. 

## Where does environment come in?

A recent study actually showed that certain traits can be more affected by the environment than genetics! According to the Financial Times, smoking, poverty, pollution, and more can have 10x more of an effect on predicting premature mortality than genetics. You can obviously expand on this yourself with your imagination without having to search things up: Poverty can mean less access to clean water, fresh food, and living in an area with more dangers that aren't regulated like excessive pollution, crime, and more. All of these obviously lead to a lower quality of life, and thus a weaker body that can't handle the strain it could under more ideal conditions.

So... all this to say, does your genome define you?

Your whole being: No. Your environment is a big factor! Why else would the nature vs. nurture argument go on through all this time? Because both avenues are valid and can explain a lot. But is your genome a big part of you? Yes, of course. Genetic predispositions, your appearance, disease, that can all come with the package. What I'd like to say is that your genome created you, but you must define yourself.
