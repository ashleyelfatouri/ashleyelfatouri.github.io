# Lung Cancer, Causes, and Statistics

 

## What is the frequency?
For men, the chance they will develop lung cancer is 1 in 17. For women, their chances are 1 in 18. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2025, there will be about 226,250 new cases of lung cancer. Most people diagnosed are 65 or older, with the average age of diagnosis being 70. Minimal cases are diagnosed before the age of 45. (Cancer.org) 

## How is this type of cancer typically identified/detected? 

According to Mayo Clinic, lung cancer is usually detected via scanning like MRI, CT, X-ray, PET, etc. This is usually done after symptoms show, like shortness of breath, persistent cough, chest pains, and weight loss. Cancer cells can also be identified through sputum, which can be coughed up. A biopsy can be ordered as well where specialized tools can be used in a bronchoscopy to collect a sample of lung tissue. (Mayo Clinic) 

## Any known factors that give a person a high risk of getting that specific type of cancer?

Smoking is the leading risk factor for lung cancer. 80% of lung cancer deaths are thought to be the result of tobacco smoke. For small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the numbers are even higher, and it is uncommon for some who has never smoked to have SCLC. Secondhand smoke is the third most common cause of lung cancer in the US. (Cancer.org) Exposure to various chemicals and materials also increases lung cancer risk, such as: Radon (radioactive gas released from breakdown of Uranium in soil and rocks), asbestos, diesel exhaust, and many chemicals released in various workplaces and breathed in.  

Certain dietary supplements can also increase the risk of lung cancer, like beta-carotene.  

Risk factors that cannot be changed include previous radiation therapy, air pollution, or a family history of lung cancer. 

## What stagings are used to describe this cancer?  

For non-small cell lung cancer, there are four stages: In stage one, the cancer has not spread into the lymph nodes or other parts of the body. In stage two, it may have spread to nearby lymph nodes, and the tumors are larger than in stage one. In stage three, it has likely spread to the mediastinum, the area between the lungs. In stage four, it has likely spread to the lining of the lungs or other parts of the body. 

Small cell lung cancer has only two stages: Limited is only in one lung, or without spread to the lymph nodes. Extensive is when it has spread to tissue past the affected lung. 

## What are the current available treatments for this cancer? 

Surgery is common to remove parts of the lung or even the entire lung. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are also common.  

## What is the average life expectancy for the patient? 

According to the American Lung Association, the average percentage of people alive five years after a diagnosis is 28.4%.
